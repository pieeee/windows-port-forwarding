# **Windows Port Forwarding App**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This Go application provides an intuitive way to manage **port forwarding** and **firewall rules** on Windows, making it easy to expose local application ports within your local network. It automates the otherwise cumbersome process of using `netsh` commands to enable port forwarding, ensuring a smoother experience for developers and system administrators.

---

## **Why This App Was Needed**

When working with applications that expose ports (e.g., Docker containers, web servers, or custom services), itâ€™s common to face challenges when trying to access these services from other devices on the same network. Windows does not natively support dynamic or persistent port forwarding rules through a GUI, requiring manual configuration of `netsh` commands and firewall rules every time.

This app was built to solve the following issues:
1. **Access Exposed Ports from Other Devices**: Enable seamless access to local services (e.g., `localhost:6300`) from other devices in the network (e.g., `192.168.0.230:6300`).
2. **Avoid Manual Configurations**: Simplify repetitive `netsh` and firewall configuration steps.
3. **Dynamic and Persistent Rules**: Allow dynamic creation and management of forwarding rules that persist across reboots.
4. **Centralized Management**: Provide a user-friendly interface to manage port forwarding and firewall rules without relying on multiple tools or scripts.

---

## **Features**

1. **Add Port Forwarding Rules**:
   - Dynamically forward traffic from a specific IP (`listen address`) and port (`listen port`) to another IP (`connect address`) and port (`connect port`).
   - Automatically create corresponding firewall rules to allow traffic for forwarded ports.

2. **Remove Port Forwarding Rules**:
   - Easily clean up forwarding rules and associated firewall rules from the app.

3. **List Existing Rules**:
   - View all active port forwarding and firewall rules in a centralized interface.

4. **Simple UI**:
   - A lightweight, browser-based interface built with Go and `htmx` for easy management.

5. **Hidden Operation**:
   - Can run as a background process or startup application without requiring a visible console window.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Port Proxy Rules**:
   - Uses the `netsh interface portproxy` command to add, delete, and list port forwarding rules.
2. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Automatically creates or removes firewall rules using `netsh advfirewall` to ensure traffic is allowed for forwarded ports.
3. **Database**:
   - Tracks all rules in a local SQLite database to provide persistence and easy retrieval.

---

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Go 1.20 or higher** (for building the application).
- **Windows 10/11** (or a compatible version with `netsh` available).
- **Admin Privileges**: Required to create port proxy and firewall rules.

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pieeee/windows-port-forwarding.git
cd windows-port-forwarding
```

### **Build the Application**
```bash
go build -o port-forwarding.exe
```

### **Run the Application**
```bash
port-forwarding.exe
```

By default, the app runs on `http://localhost:2233`. Open this URL in your browser to manage port forwarding rules.

---

## **Usage**

### **Add a Rule**
1. Open the app at `http://localhost:2233`.
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Rule Name**: A descriptive name for the rule.
   - **Listen Address**: The IP address to listen for incoming traffic (default: local machine's IP).
   - **Listen Port**: The port to forward traffic from.
   - **Connect Address**: The destination IP address (default: `127.0.0.1`).
   - **Connect Port**: The port to forward traffic to.
3. Click **Add Rule** to create the rule.

### **List Rules**
- View all active port proxy and firewall rules in the table on the main page.

### **Remove a Rule**
- Click the **Remove** button next to a rule to delete both the port proxy and firewall rule.

## **Startup Option**

To automatically start the app at system boot, add the executable to the **Startup Folder**:
1. Press `Win + R` and type:
   ```plaintext
   shell:startup
   ```
2. Copy the `port-forwarding.exe` file to this folder.

---

## **Technical Details**

- **Backend**: Go with `netsh` commands for port proxy and firewall management.
- **Database**: SQLite for persistent rule storage.
- **Frontend**: Minimal HTML UI with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic updates.
- **Port Forwarding**: Uses `netsh interface portproxy` for traffic redirection.
- **Firewall Rules**: Configures Windows Firewall automatically for each port forwarding rule.

---

## **Limitations**

1. **Local Network Only**: This app is designed for managing ports within the local network (LAN).
2. **Admin Rights Required**: Creating port proxy and firewall rules requires administrative privileges.

---

## **Future Improvements**

1. **System Tray Integration**: Add a tray icon for quick access and notifications.
2. **TLS Support**: Secure the web interface with HTTPS.
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Extend functionality to Linux and macOS.
4. **Advanced Firewall Rules**: Add options for IP ranges and protocols.
